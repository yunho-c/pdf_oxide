///
/// **Rule 1**: TJ offset triggered flag
/// - If the TJ processor set the flag due to negative offset > threshold, insert space
/// - This is explicit PDF positioning information
/// - Confidence: 0.95 (highest, explicit signal)
///
/// **Rule 2**: Dual threshold (PDFBox pattern) with document-type adjustment
/// - Calculate both space-width-based and char-width-based thresholds
/// - Adjust thresholds based on document type (Academic/Policy/Mixed)
/// - Use MINIMUM of the two for robustness
/// - If gap exceeds this threshold, insert space
/// - Confidence: 0.8 (geometric measurement)
///
/// **Rule 3**: Character heuristic (CamelCase, number->letter, etc.)
/// - Detect character transitions indicating word boundaries
/// - If heuristic fires, insert space
/// - Confidence: 0.6 (pattern-based)
///
/// **Rule 4**: Conservative threshold (document-type aware)
/// - If gap exceeds conservative threshold (very small), insert space
/// - Catches small intentional gaps that are still word boundaries
/// - Adaptive to document type (Policy uses lower threshold, Academic uses higher)
/// - Confidence: 0.5 (conservative)
///
/// **Default**: No space inserted
///
/// # Document Type Adjustment
///
/// When document_type is provided, thresholds are adjusted:
/// - **Academic** (1.4x multiplier): Higher thresholds for loose spacing
/// - **Policy** (0.6x multiplier): Lower thresholds for tight justified text
/// - **Mixed** (1.0x multiplier): Default/balanced approach
